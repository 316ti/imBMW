[imBMW] is .NET Micro Framework and hardware project. 
It was started to add custom features to cars with [iBus] interface 
such as '91-'10 BMWs and some models of Mini, Land Rover, Rover, MG and Rolls Royce. 

The imBMW device connects iPod, radio unit and other car modules and devices to each other.

and other modules to receive notifications and control doors, windows, lights, etc.
